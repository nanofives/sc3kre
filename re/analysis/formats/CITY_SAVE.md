# CITY_SAVE.md — the SC3 city / terrain / scenario file family

Cracked at the **container level** 2026-08-16. This was the last outstanding P2 format.

## The headline: they are `.IXF` containers

Every shipped city-family file is a GZ `.IXF` indexed database segment — the **same container**
already fully parsed by `re/tools/ixf_parse.py` for localized text and sprite archives.

```
Cities\Berlin, Germany.sc3   ->  d7 81 c3 80 ...   = 0x80C381D7, the .IXF magic
```

| extension | what it is | files | records |
|---|---|---|---|
| `.sc3` | saved cities | 15 | 189 |
| `.sct` | terrains | 21 | 254 |
| `.snr` | scenarios | 13 | 459 |
| `.st3` | starter towns | 10 | 90 |
| **total** | | **59** | **992** |

**59 of 59 parse cleanly with the existing parser, no changes required.** The container needed no
new work at all — the 20-byte index `{group, instance, type, offset, size}` and the tombstone /
end-of-index rules documented in `formats/IXF_segment.md` all hold.

Example — `Berlin, Germany.sc3`, 781,807 bytes, 13 records:

| type | group | instance | size |
|---|---|---|---|
| `0x035f62a4` | `0x035f62a4` | 1 | **743,406** ← the city data blob |
| `0xe2f42628` | `0x62f42635` | 0 | 17,663 |
| `0x00000fa1` | `0x617e198d` | 0 | 94 |
| `0x035ad1cb` | `0x835ad1d1` | 0 | 24 |
| … | | | |

## What is NOT the SC3 save format `[FALSIFIED]`

`SIMINIT.DLL` contains an IFF-style chunk reader — `sc3_init_read_chunked_file` `0x10001ada`
`[CONFIRMED @0x10001ada]` — that loops `{u32 tag, u32 length, payload}` with **both dwords
byte-swapped** (`FUN_10025ef1`), reading through the GZCOM stream primitive `vt+0x38`. Its tag
table at `0x100371f0` holds, in order:

```
XZON  XBLD  XTER  ALTM  MISC  SCDH  FORM
```

Those are **SimCity 2000 `.sc2` chunk tags** (zones, buildings, terrain, altitude map). It is a
**legacy `.sc2` importer**, *not* the SC3 city format — the shipped `.sc3`/`.sct`/`.snr`/`.st3`
files are `.IXF` and contain no `FORM` header.

> This was very nearly recorded the wrong way round. The chunk table looked exactly like a save
> format, and only checking the first bytes of a real `.sc3` file showed the container was
> `.IXF`. **Read the shipped bytes before naming a format after the code that reads *a* format.**

## What is still open

The **record payloads**. The container is solved; the contents are not. Priorities:

1. **The 743 KB blob** (`type == group == 0x035f62a4`, instance 1) — almost certainly the tile
   grids. `[UNCERTAIN]` its internal layout; nothing has been read yet.
2. Map `type`/`group` ids to meaning. The ids repeat across files, so a cross-file diff of the
   small records (24-94 bytes) against known city properties should name several cheaply.
3. **The decoding route is already identified:** GZCOM serialisers are **mirror pairs** — a
   reader calling stream `vt+0x38` on field *addresses* and a writer calling `vt+0x88` on field
   *values*, over the same offsets in the same order (see `ROADMAP.md` P2 note, first proven on
   the SIMGEOM pair `0x1001e516` / `0x1001e226`). **A serialiser's field order IS the on-disk
   record layout.** Find the serialiser that handles type `0x035f62a4` and the blob is decoded.

## Tooling

No new parser needed for the container: `py -3.12 re/tools/ixf_parse.py "Cities\<file>.sc3"`.
